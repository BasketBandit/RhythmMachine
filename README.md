# JAVA-RhythmMachine


As the description suggests, this repository is purely for my own experimental code. Things that I'm playing around with and try to learn more about. Below I will list what is currently being experimented with with the newest addition being added at the bottom of the list.

## Paint, canvas and sine waves.

I've been looking into how to properly make GUIs within Java but got side tracked into making a video game (which gave me a simple type of engine to work with for constant updates) and now how to simply make a GUI using 2D graphics and such. Taking it one step at a time or a few steps in this case. :)

## TravisCI, how to actually implement.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Galaxiosaurus/JAVA-RhythmMachine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Galaxiosaurus/JAVA-RhythmMachine)

Note: To get travis working, you need to create a .travis.yml file in the project root, generate an ant build, (named build.xml for ease of use) edit the build.xml file and add <target name="test"></target> to appease Travis, Push a commit to trigger a Travis build and then upload the badge icon via markdown to the README.md file.

## KeyListeners and then some.

I always wanted to be able to give some kind of input to a program. This time around I was able to achieve this and I wanted to press how far I could take that in the short amount of time I have been looking into it. From this and using techniques I have previously learnt I've started to create a Dwarf Fortress type game out of ascii characters. So far you can move around and I've already implemented objects you can't pass but I'll see where I can take this.
